# File Sharing App - Test Instructions

This README provides instructions on running tests for the File Sharing App.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 or higher)
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) (optional but recommended)

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. If you're not using a virtual environment, you can skip this section.

## Install the required dependencies using the following command:

# pip install -r requirements.txt


## To run the tests, execute the following command:

# pytest -v --html=pytest_report.html


## Once the tests are completed, you can view the HTML report by opening pytest_report.html in a web browser.


```bash
# Install virtualenv (if not installed)
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
